## Summary

You can see a demo of the app here: [DEMO](https://alannahw.github.io/splash-app-demo/)

Splash App is creative writing helper. It uses the magnificent Unplash photo library
[here](https://unsplash.com/) and pairs a randomly selected image with an unusual
title to get that inspiration rolling. If you already have something in mind however,
everything is customisable.
